               <h2>Ingredients</h2>
               <ul>
                    <li>1 (14-ounce can) (400g) whole peeled tomatoes</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic minced or crushed</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>¼ cup parmesan cheese or pecorino romano grated, plus extra for serving</li>
                    <li>8 oz (225g) penne pasta</li>
                    <li>5 fresh basil leaves chiffonaded</li>
               </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                 <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat oil, tomato paste, garlic, pepper flakes, paprika, and salt, while stirring occasionally. Cook for 6-7 minutes or until you get a deep red colored sauce.</li>
                 <li>Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer, breaking the tomatoes down with a wooden spoon as they cook. Keep cooking, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
                 <li>In the meantime, cook the penne in salted water according to the package instructions until just “al dente”. Reserve pasta water in case you need to use it later.</li>
                 <li>Drain the cooked pasta, and add it to the tomato sauce. If needed, adjust the consistency by adding reserved pasta water.</li>
                 <li>Add the parmesan or pecorino romano cheese, and stir a few times until it melts.</li>
                 <li>Garnish with chopped basil and/or parsley leaves, serve warm with extra parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Recipe Site Examples</h2>
            <p class="instruction">Three links to recipe websites you have found, with a short (2-3 sentences) written review/critique for each, explaining what makes this site a good reference</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/basil-three-cheese-ravioli-no-cook-fresh-tomato-sauce">Food and Wine</a></li>
                <p>Food and Wine's website is easy to navigate and has a clear hierarchy that helps its comprehensibility. I also appreciated that it got straight to the recipe, rather than shoving it towards the very bottom of the page, as a lot of recipe sites tend to do. Food and Wine also suggests what kind of wine you should pair with the recipe, which I think is a nice addition to the page, especially since it fits their brand as a Food and Wine magazine/site.</p>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/143069/super-delicious-zuppa-toscana/">All Recipes</a></li>
                <p>All Recipes's site is also super clear and easy to navigate. Like Food and Wine, they also start the recipe right at the top of page, making it easy for the user to find and follow the recipe. Their ads are off the side and feel less intrusive than other sites with ads. They also put a photo gallery at the beginning of the recipe, which allows the viewer to quickly see what the meal should look like.</p>
                <li><a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a22537192/garlic-spaghetti-recipe/">Delish</a></li>
                <p>Delish's website also has a clear and easy to follow structure. Unlike my previous examples, however, Delish organized their recipe in two columns, with the ingredients on the left and the directions on the right. That structure allows the viewer to see all the necessary info at the same time on the same page without needing to scroll back and forth.</p>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h2>Non-Recipe Site Examples</h2>
            <p class="instruction">Three links to non-recipe websites with stylistic or communication techniques that might inform your own design, also with a short written rationale</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-hem-pants-1106177">The Spruce Crafts</a></li>
                <p>The Spruce Crafts's page on "How to Hem Pants" uses a combination of photo and written instructions to help guide the viewer through the process. I like the way they have a photo with each step, as I feel it's really helpful for the viewer to have a visual aid. I feel like I could potentially utlize a similar technique when designing my recipe page.</p>
                <li><a href="https://www.skimag.com/performance/top-10-tips-beginners/">Ski Mag</a></li>
                <p>Ski Mag's page on "Tips for Skiing" also utilizes pictures with each step. This is really successful for their content, as I think visual aids are also super helpful with something like learning how to ski. Again, this is something I could use in my recipe.</p>
                <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-screenshot-on-windows">Business Insider</a></li>
                <p>Business Insider's website offers a handful of clear tips to properly screenshot on Windows. They have a clear hierarchy established. This is something I could use in my recipe site.</p>
