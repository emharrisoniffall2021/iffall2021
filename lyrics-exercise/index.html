        <p>I see it <br>
            Crawling up the walls, towards the ceiling <br>
            Oh my love you never would believe it<br>
            William, what is this feeling?</p>
        <p>I'm tired <br>
            Laying in the forest by the water<br>
            Underneath these ferns you'll never find me<br>
            William, why am I hiding?</p>
        <p>I kept it together in the house that you haunted<br>
            I whispered your name but you never responded<br>
            I feel it, your spirit is free<br>
            William, she never loved me</p>
         <p>I waited<br>
            Hoping something somehow could stay sacred<br>
            Every little meaning keeps escaping<br>
            William, what am I chasing?</p>
        <p>It's ugly<br>
            Why does every moment have to leave me?<br>
            I try so hard to hold on to this memory<br>
            William, I still feel empty</p>
        <p>It's always a mystery to love and be loved<br>
            I can bury these feelings they keep rising up<br>
            Tell me, why is a lifetime not enough?<br>
            William, what am I so afraid of?</p>
        <p>My heart, my heart stopped beating<br>
            My lungs, my lungs stopped breathing<br>
            My head, my head stopped thinking again</p>
        <p>My heart, my heart stopped beating<br>
            My lungs, my lungs stopped breathing<br>
            My head, my head stopped thinking again</p>
        <p>I kept it together and my heart it stopped beating<br>
            I whispered your name and my lungs they stopped breathing<br>
            I feel it, your spirit - my head stopped thinking again<br>
            William, when is this gonna end?</p>
