            <dt>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</dd>
            <dd>My name is Emma Harrison. I am junior, majoring in Communication Design and minoring in Marketing.</dt>
                <p></p>
            <dt>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</dt>
            <dd>I don't have much computer science and coding background, but I think it would be really helpful to learn! 
                Eventually I would like to be able to code my portfolio site from scratch.</dd>
            <p></p>
            <dt>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</dt>
            <dd>I don't have much expereince with HTML/CSS/JS. I learned a little bit of HTML in middle school, 
                but unfortunately, I don't remember much! </dd>
            <p></p>
            <dt>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</dt>
            <dd>I hope to learn how to make a website, so I can use that for my portfolio site.</dd>
            <p></p>
            <dt>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</dt>
            <dd>When designing for the screen, you have to take into consideration how your design will function not only on a 
                desktop, but on mobile, ipad, etc.
            <p></p>
            <dt>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</dt>
            <dd>One website I think have an effective design is 
                <a href=https://riflepaperco.com/>the Rifle Paper Co.</a>
                The website is easy to navigate as a user, and the home page directs the viewer to their different 
                available products. Images and type are clear and easy to digest while also providing necessary information.</dd>  
            <p></p>
                <dt>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</dt>
            <dd>One website I think have an effective communication is 
                <a href=https://www.ptscoffee.com//>PT's Coffee Roasting Co.</a> 
            I think their design displays effective communication because their main links on their front page are distinct and clear
            categories that are necessary to their brand. i.e. The first 3 links are coffee, merch, and cafes. If a customer 
            ends up on their website looking for cafe locations, they will be easily directed there because of the clear communication
            on their website.</dd>
            <p></p>
            <dt>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</dt>
            <dd>One website I think works well is 
                <a href=https://baboontothemoon.com//>Baboon to the Moon</a> I think they're a good example of a good website because
                the website is easy to navigate and it's an accurate representation of the brand. Some of the design choices on their site
                aren't my favorite, but it matches the brand's personality and aesthetic perfectly.
